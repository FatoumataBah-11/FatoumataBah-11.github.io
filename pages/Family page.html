            <p>Here is a little bit about my family members:</p>

                <h3>Family Member 1</h3>
                <p>This is my brother. He is a very sweet guy when he wants to be. He has helped me in a lot of ways. I
                    am forever grateful.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="family-member">
                <img src="../assets/images/IMG_4471.JPEG" alt="Family Member 2 - Boy" />
                <h3>Family Member 2</h3>
                <p>My other brother who I am also grateful for. He just came to America so he's still learning how to
                    navigate our world.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="family-member">
                <img src="../assets/images/IMG_4427.JPEG" alt="Family Member 3 - Girl" />
                <h3>Family Member 3</h3>
                <p>This is my little sister. I know she looks older than me because that's what everyone says. But she's
                    pretty cool. Acts like me a little but overall she is chill.</p>
