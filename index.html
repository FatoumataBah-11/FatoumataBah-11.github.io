        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am from New York City. I came to Cincinnati , Ohio when I was almost done with Highschool. I ended up
            finishing
            high school here. I am an equal extrovert and introvert depends on who I am with. I enjot basketball. My
            favorite sport is Basketball. I have played on countless teams and been scouted but I never choose to chose
            that cereer path. I chose to be a Cybersecurity major because
            I am confident that I will get a good job that will help me improve and learn and grow more as I go in this
            journey called life. Also possibly afford my future life.
